Theme: Smart Mobility & Access Management

Overview:
SAARTHI is an innovative mobile app and admin platform designed to address the challenges of crowd management, navigation, and accessibility in large gatherings such as festivals, religious events, and urban crowds. The system combines real-time monitoring, AI-driven predictions, personalized navigation, and hyperlocal communication to ensure safety, efficiency, and inclusivity for all participants.

Core Problems Addressed:

Overcrowding in micro-locations like ghats, entry gates, and narrow streets, which often goes unmanaged.

Navigation difficulties in complex or unfamiliar areas, causing delays and confusion.

Limited accessibility support for Divyangjan and elderly users.

Delayed emergency response due to lack of real-time, localized communication.

VIP movements disrupting general crowd flow.

Spread of misinformation and rumors leading to panic.

Inability for authorities to send targeted, location-specific alerts.

Lack of predictive insights for crowd surges and resource allocation.

Key Features & Functionalities:

Checkpoint System: Tracks current crowd numbers at checkpoints, predicts next checkpoint arrivals, and guides users to avoid congested areas.

400m Radius Monitoring: Provides users with real-time awareness of nearby crowd density, helping them make safe navigation choices.

Targeted Location Messaging: Sends zone-specific alerts and updates to users in defined areas without disturbing others.

Hyperlocal Smart Zoning: Creates dynamic 100m² micro-zones for precise communication and congestion management.

Personalized Navigation: Offers step-by-step guidance to key locations with live adjustments based on crowd flow.

Inclusive Accessibility Mode: Highlights accessible pathways, alerts nearby users, and ensures assistance for Divyangjan and elderly participants.

VIP Mode: Provides exclusive paths and checkpoints for verified VIPs, maintaining smooth crowd flow.

Two-Way Local Communication: Enables users to ask questions, report issues, and receive feedback from people nearby.

AI-Powered Insights & Predictions: Predicts crowd surges, suggests safest paths, and recommends optimal visiting times.

Emergency & Medical Support Integration: Sends instant alerts to nearby medical teams and authorities for quick response.

Why SAARTHI Stands Out:

Proactive & Predictive: Moves from reactive crowd management to anticipating and preventing issues.

Inclusive & Accessible: Ensures all participants, including Divyangjan, elderly, and VIPs, navigate safely.

Community-Driven & Hyperlocal: Empowers users to assist each other while providing authorities with real-time, actionable insights.

Scalable & Future-Ready: Works offline, integrates with existing city infrastructure, and can be adapted for mega-events, markets, or smart city deployments.

Conclusion:
SAARTHI transforms the chaotic experience of large gatherings into a safe, organized, and stress-free environment. By combining hyperlocal monitoring, AI insights, inclusive navigation, and real-time communication, it provides a search-less, type-less, effortless smart assistant for both users and authorities.
