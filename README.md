1. Overview

SAARTHI is an innovative smart crowd management & navigation app with an admin platform to ensure safe and efficient movement of people in large gatherings such as festivals, religious events, and urban crowds. It combines:

Real-time monitoring

AI-driven predictions

Personalized navigation

Hyperlocal communication

This ensures safety, inclusivity, and convenience for participants while empowering authorities with actionable insights.

2. Problem & Solution

Problem Statement:

Overcrowding in micro-locations like ghats, entry gates, and narrow streets.

Difficult navigation in large or unfamiliar areas.

Limited accessibility for Divyangjan & elderly.

Delayed emergency response and poor communication.

VIP movements disrupting general crowd flow.

Spread of misinformation & rumors causing panic.

No system for targeted, location-based alerts.

Lack of predictive insights for managing surges.

Solution:
SAARTHI provides a proactive, AI-powered system that:

Tracks checkpoint density & predicts surges.

Provides personalized and safe navigation.

Supports accessibility & VIP-only routes.

Sends targeted alerts to specific zones.

Monitors 400m radius crowd density for user awareness.

Automates emergency alerts with live coordinates.

Helps admins with real-time dashboards, insights & crowd control.

3. Logic & Workflow

Data Collection:

GPS location of users

Checkpoint entries & exits

Real-time density data (sensors, app-based reports)

Processing:

AI generates crowd heatmaps

Predictive models forecast surges

Rules trigger alerts for congestion or anomalies

Output:

Step-by-step navigation with safe path suggestions

Zone-specific alerts & instructions

Live dashboard for admins with facility tracking

User Side:

Login via Google/Guest

Search-less navigation to toilets, ghats, parking, etc.

400m radius crowd awareness

Accessibility & VIP modes

Issue reporting with live coordinates

Admin Side:

Real-time dashboard with checkpoints & facilities

Add/manage locations (toilets, medical, parking, etc.)

Zone-based targeted messaging

Resource allocation insights

Control for VIP & accessibility modes

4. Tech Stack

Frontend (Mobile App): Android (Java/XML)

Backend: Node.js + Express

Database: MongoDB, Firebase Realtime Database

AI & Processing: Python (crowd prediction, anomaly detection)

Maps & Navigation: Google Maps API

Authentication: Firebase Auth (Google/Guest login)

5. Key Features & Functionalities

Checkpoint System: Tracks current & predicted crowd numbers.

400m Radius Monitoring: Nearby density awareness.

Targeted Location Messaging: Zone-specific alerts.

Hyperlocal Smart Zoning: Dynamic 100m² micro-zones.

Inclusive Accessibility Mode: Pathways & assistance alerts.

VIP Mode: Exclusive checkpoints & routes.

Two-Way Communication: Reports & queries from users.

AI Predictions: Crowd surges, safe paths, best time to visit.

Emergency Support: Quick medical & guard allocation.

6. Future Scope

Integration with IoT sensors & CCTV feeds for accuracy.

Stampede prediction & evacuation planning with advanced AI.

Offline mode for poor connectivity areas.

Expansion to sports events, concerts, disaster management, and smart cities.

Scalable for multi-city, national-level deployments.

7. Why SAARTHI Stands Out

Proactive & Predictive – prevents problems before they arise.

Inclusive & Accessible – designed for Divyangjan, elderly & VIPs.

Community-Driven & Hyperlocal – empowers users & authorities simultaneously.

Scalable & Future-Ready – adaptable for mega-events & smart cities.

Conclusion

SAARTHI transforms the chaotic experience of large gatherings into a safe, organized, and effortless journey. With AI insights, hyperlocal monitoring, real-time communication, and inclusive navigation, it ensures a search-less, type-less, effortless smart assistant for both users and authorities.
